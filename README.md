# CodeWars Challenges
**Purpose** This repo is filled with my codewar challenges/kata submissions. I solve at least one codewars challenge every day.

**Link to Profile:** https://www.codewars.com/users/xcChinaxc

## How It's Made
**Tech Used:** JavaScript <br />
**Lessons Learned:** It's ok to take a break from a kata and come back to it later. There are plenty of other katas to solve and by solving those katas, I'll learn something new.
